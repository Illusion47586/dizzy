# dizzy

An app to check if you are dizzy or not, and further telling if you should drive or not.

## Techstack
* framework: flutter
* backend: firebase

## Procedure
Simple, to check for dizzyness, just give the user a bunch of random directions to move their head into, check the latency, if it exceeds a certain limit, boom you have mr/mrs dizzy right there.

We can also check for mobile wobbling to give the user a warning without even giving the test.
